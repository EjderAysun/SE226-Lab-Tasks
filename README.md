## General Info
* **Laboratory tasks**, **solutions**, and other **related documents** given each week are in the _relevant week's file_.
* This repo was created to share the solutions to the tasks and to facilitate the control of the solutions by the course assistant. In addition, it is developing by adding tasks and other relevant documents.

## Course Objectives[[1]](https://se.ieu.edu.tr/en/syllabus/type/read/id/SE+226)
The main objective of this course is to **improve programming skills** of students in multiple languages. Python and C++ languages will be used. Students will be exposed to commonly used **data structures**, **libraries**, **methodologies** and tools by experiencing them _first in theory_, _then in practical laboratory sessions_. Students will prepare a project that meets the requirements by applying methods given in the course.

## Inspiration
Software Engineering 226 (SE 226) LAB Instructions (Izmir University of Economics, 2023, SE 226 course, Spring Semester laboratory tasks)
  
As a student of the Izmir University of Economics, I made these tasks in accordance with the SE 226 laboratory tasks instructions for the spring semester laboratory tasks of the SE 226 course in 2023.
  
The repo conforms almost exactly to the document. It is highly personalized.
  
I share documents publicly. The contents of the SE 226 projects that will be given in the future may be similar to this document. If you have an ethical responsibility based on this or a similar course, assignment, or task, please use this as an opinion only. If you have a question or need more information about the solutions, send an email to me: <ejderaysunn@gmail.com>
